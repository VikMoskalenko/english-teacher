User Story for "Dream Teacher" Website
As a group of Dream Teachers, we want to create a website that provides key information about our team, the types of lessons we offer, and our values. The website should also display the prices for each lesson and allow users to book a trial lesson.

Key features include:

Section about: Information about the teachers, including their qualifications and experience.

Types of Lessons: A list of available lesson types (e.g., private, group, specialized).

Values and Prices: Clear details on the values we promote and the pricing for each type of lesson.

Trial Lesson Booking: Users should be able to book a trial lesson with us.

Payment Integration: Ability to complete payments securely for lessons.

Social Media Links: Direct links to our social media profiles to keep users engaged.

Admin Panel: A backend to track who books a lesson and manage scheduling efficiently.

This website should help us attract new students, streamline the booking process, and provide a smooth payment experience.
